# Traffic Intersection Security Camera Installation Optimization
Welcome to the Traffic Intersection Security Camera Installation Optimization project! ðŸš¦ðŸ“¹

## Project Overview
This project aims to assist local police departments in optimizing the installation of security cameras at traffic intersections. By solving a specific optimization problem known as the Vertex Cover problem, we strive to minimize the number of cameras required while maximizing monitoring effectiveness.

## Project Structure
This project is structured into a series of assignments, culminating in a comprehensive solution:

### Street and Road Segments Generation (Python):
Python code for generating street layouts and segments based on input data.

### Shortest Distance Calculation (C++):
Implementation of algorithms such as Djikstra's or Breadth First Search (BFS) to determine the shortest distances between different streets.

### Integration and Concurrent Processing:
Integration of Python street generation and C++ shortest distance calculation using pipes and forks for concurrent operation.

### Optimization using SAT Solver (C++):
Utilizing a SAT solver based on CNF-SAT reduction to optimize the shortest path calculation.

### Multithreading and Algorithm Evaluation:
Implementing multithreading, including I/O handling, CNF-SAT computation, and approximation-based algorithms.
Random generation of streets to evaluate algorithm performance across different vertex values.

## Project Folders
The project is organized into four main folders, representing different stages of development and assignment completion.

## Installation and Usage
